Task 1: Add a New Student
Find the <ul> element with the id student-list.
Create a new <li> element.
Create a new text node with the name "David".
Append the text node to the new <li> element.
Append the new <li> element to the end of the student-list (<ul>).

Task 2: Add a Transfer Student with an ID
Create another new <li> element.
Set its text content to "Eve".
Using setAttribute(), give this new <li> element an id of transfer-student.
Append this new <li> element to the student-list.

Task 3: Analyze "Bob"
Find the <li> element containing "Bob". (A good way to do this is to get all children of the student-list and access the second one, e.g., list.children[1]).
Log "Bob's" parentElement (which should be the <ul>).
Log "Bob's" previousElementSibling (which should be "Alice").
Log "Bob's" nextElementSibling (which should be "Charlie").

Task 4: Highlight "Charlie"
Find the <li> element containing "Charlie".
Using setAttribute(), add a class attribute to it with the value highlight. (The CSS in the <head> will then style it).
